# CLI installation and authentication

## Installation

### Prerequisites

The Knock CLI requires Node.js 18+ or can be installed via Homebrew on macOS.

### Installation methods

**Using npm (recommended):**

```bash
npm install -g @knocklabs/cli
```

**Using Homebrew (macOS):**

```bash
brew install knocklabs/tap/knock
```

**Verify installation:**

```bash
knock --version
```

### Expectation for agents

When working with a project that uses Knock, the CLI should already be installed. If the `knock` command is not available:

1. First attempt to install it using `npm install -g @knocklabs/cli`
2. If npm is not available, try Homebrew on macOS
3. If installation fails, inform the user that the Knock CLI needs to be installed

### Important: Interactive prompts and the `--force` flag

Many Knock CLI commands use interactive prompts (y/N confirmations, multi-step wizards, browser-based auth). These prompts will cause commands to hang or default to "no" if not handled.

**For agents and scripts:** Most commands that prompt support a `--force` flag that skips all confirmation prompts. Always use `--force` when running commands non-interactively:

```bash
knock workflow pull <workflow-key> --force
knock pull --all --force
knock commit promote --to=production --force
```

Some commands like `knock init`, `knock auth login`, and `knock workflow new` are fully interactive and don't support `--force`. Use their explicit flags (e.g., `--knock-dir`, `--key`, `--steps`) to avoid prompts, or have the user run them manually.

See the CLI commands reference (`rules/cli-commands-reference.md`) for a full table of which commands prompt, which support `--force`, and which are safe to run directly.

## Authentication

The Knock CLI supports two authentication methods: service tokens (recommended for CI/CD and automation) and interactive dashboard login (for local development).

### Method 1: Service token authentication (recommended)

Service tokens are the preferred method for automated workflows and CI/CD pipelines.

**Setting up a service token:**

1. Generate a service token from the Knock dashboard under Developer settings
2. Set the environment variable:

```bash
export KNOCK_SERVICE_TOKEN=<your-service-token>
```

**Using in commands:**

```bash
# The CLI automatically uses KNOCK_SERVICE_TOKEN if set
knock pull --all

# Or pass explicitly
knock pull --all --service-token=<your-service-token>
```

**Best practices for service tokens:**

- Store tokens securely in environment variables or secrets management
- Use different tokens for different environments (development, staging, production)
- Rotate tokens periodically
- Never commit tokens to version control

### Method 2: Dashboard account authentication

For local development, you can authenticate using your Knock dashboard account.

**Interactive login (requires browser — cannot be automated by agents):**

```bash
knock auth login
```

This opens a browser window for authentication. Once authenticated, credentials are stored locally. Because this requires browser interaction, it must be run manually by the user—agents cannot complete this flow.

**Check authentication status:**

```bash
knock auth whoami
```

**Logout:**

```bash
knock auth logout
```

## Environment configuration

### Working with multiple environments

Knock supports multiple environments (development, staging, production). Specify the environment when running commands:

```bash
# Pull from development environment
knock pull --all --environment=development

# Push to production
knock push --all --environment=production
```

### Environment variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `KNOCK_SERVICE_TOKEN` | Service token for authentication |
| `KNOCK_API_ORIGIN` | Custom API origin (rarely needed) |

## Project initialization

After authentication, initialize your project:

```bash
knock init
```

This creates a `knock.json` configuration file in your project root. See the directory structure documentation for details on this file.

## Troubleshooting

### Common issues

**"Command not found: knock"**
- The CLI is not installed or not in PATH
- Try reinstalling: `npm install -g @knocklabs/cli`

**"Authentication required"**
- Set the `KNOCK_SERVICE_TOKEN` environment variable
- Or run `knock auth login` for interactive authentication

**"Invalid service token"**
- Verify the token is correct and hasn't been revoked
- Check if the token has access to the target environment

**"Permission denied"**
- The authenticated user/token may lack permissions for the operation
- Verify role assignments in the Knock dashboard

### Verifying setup

Run this command to verify your setup is working:

```bash
knock whoami
```

This displays the authenticated account and available environments.
